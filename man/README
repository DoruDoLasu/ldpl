To recompile a man page for LDPL, clone the LDPL documentation repository
(git clone https://www.github.com/lartu/ldpl-docs) in this folder.

Then copy compileman.php and ldplman-intro into the cloned folder and
go inside it. Then run:

  $ php compileman.php > ldpl.1

A file called ldpl.1 will be generated. Copy it to the previous
folder and delete the cloned folder.

You can add it to your the new man file to your man pages or just open it by
running:
    
  $ man ./ldpl.1

Please note that as man pages for LDPL are generated from the LDPL
documentation, they SHOULD NEVER be edited by hand.
