To compile a man page for LDPL clone the ldpl documentation repository
(www.github.com/lartu/ldpl-docs) in this folder (so that every file
in that repository is in this very folder) and then run:

  $ php compileman.php > ldpl.man

A file called ldpl.man will be generated. You can add it to your
man pages or just open it by running:
    
  $ man ./ldpl.man
