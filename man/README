To recompile a man page for LDPL, clone the LDPL documentation repository
(git clone https://www.github.com/lartu/ldpl-docs) in this folder (so that
every file in that repository is in this very folder) and then run:

  $ php compileman.php > ldpl.1

A file called ldpl.man will be generated. You can add it to your
man pages or just open it by running:
    
  $ man ./ldpl.1

Please note that as man pages for LDPL are generated from the LDPL
documentation, they SHOULD NEVER be edited by hand.
