.SH NAME
ldpl - The LDPL programming language compiler

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
ldpl [-i=<extension file>]... <source file>|-c
     [-o=<output name>|-r] [-f=<c++ flag>]... [-n]
.br
ldpl [-v|-h]

For more information on these options you can run "ldpl -h".

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program compiles LDPL source code into executable binaries.
LDPL is a programming language designed from the ground up to be excessively expressive, fast, readable and easy to learn.
In order to be able to properly compile LDPL executables you
.I
must
have a valid C++ compiler on your $PATH linked to the name 'c++'.

Documentation and reference for the LDPL Programming Language can be found in the sections below.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
-v, --version
    Print out LDPL version info and release details.

-h, --help
    Print this list of options.

-r
    By using -r you can just compile the project and print the C++ representation for that code.

-o=<name>
    You can set the output file for the compiled binary with the -o flag. For example, if you want to name your program "dog", you could compile it with ldpl -o=dog main.ldpl.

-i=<file>
    Extensions can be imported by using this flag; see the Extensions section.

-f=<flag>
    The -f flag can be used to add flags to the C++ compilation line. See the Building C++ Extensions section for more information.

-n, --non-static
    On Linux and Windows platforms, LDPL builds static binaries by default. If you want to build non-static ones use the -ns flag. To build on Android Termux you must use this flag.

-c
    The -c flag tells LDPL to accept source code from the standard input.
